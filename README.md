## Run the following steps in order to de-link a token and client.
1. Select all 'non-deployed' tokens from tokens table.
    ```mysql
    select * from tokens where status != 1; 
    ``` 
2. Set client_id for all the tokens as NULL. If you need to de-link only a particular token, please update the query accordingly.
    ```mysql
    UPDATE `tokens` SET client_id_was = client_id, client_id = NULL, debug = ('{\"disassociation_reason\":\"Token holder in openst.js v0.10.0-beta.1 had wrong callprefix for executeTransaction and executeRedemption.\"}'), updated_at='2019-03-27 00:32:03.569' WHERE (status != 1);
    ```
3. Select all workflows where workflow kind is 'tokenDeployKind'.
    ```mysql
    select * from workflows where kind = 1;
    ``` 
4. Set unique_hash as NULL. If you need to de-link only a particular token, please update the query accordingly.
    ```mysql
    update workflows set unique_hash = NULL where kind = 1;
    ```
